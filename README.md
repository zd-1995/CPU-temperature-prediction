# CPU-temperature-prediction
CPU temperature prediction using neural network
In this project, we want to predict the temperature in 10 seconds with dual-core cpu temperature information. Using cnn and lstm neural network, we have trained a model to predict cpu temperature.
The results of the two networks in benchmarks for seconds 2 to 5 are given below.

Also, the temperature forecast in 10 seconds is as follows:
